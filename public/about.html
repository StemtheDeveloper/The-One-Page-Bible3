        <h1>About: The One-Page Bible</h1>
    
        <p><strong>Welcome to The One-Page Bible!</strong></p>
    
        <p>This personal project was inspired by a vision to see the entire Bible all at once, in one comprehensive view. "The One-Page Bible" was created to help visualize the vast array of connections and references God's Word contains. Having everything on one page allows you to see just how massive it is, and you can easily find out which book is the longest or shortest. This resource is designed to be useful for students or anyone wanting to know more about our wonderful faith, our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    
        <p>Currently a work in progress, I plan to add more helpful features to aid in unlocking the mysteries of the Word. Some of these planned features include:</p>
    
        <ul>
        <li>A highlighter to draw and write notes</li>
        <li>Multiple language translations</li>
        <li>Multiple versions</li>
        <li>A word/verse finder</li>
        <li>A link network that shows all the references to a particular verse, chapter, or book</li>
        </ul>
