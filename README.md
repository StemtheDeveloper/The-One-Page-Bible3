# The-One-Page-Bible3
The One Page Bible is a resource for learning the Bible and seeing it in a unique, helpful way. 

Hi welcome to The One Page Bible! My name is Stiaan Viljoen, I am a developer from New Zealand. The One Page Bible is a dream I have had for a long time, I feel that seeing the whole Bible on one page provides several benefits such as being able to see the bigger picture. Although the Bible is comprized of 66 books, these books were chosen to be a part of then canon Bible because they all follow the same story of Gods salvation through his Son, Jesus Christ. With the The One Page Bible I hope to simplify comparison between books and verses to better understand the wider narrative of scripture.

This is and open project, so all feedback is welcomed. If you find errors or have some helpful ideas feel free to share at stem@theredboxsoftware.com.

I hope you find this resource useful.

INSTRUCTIONS:
* Click and drag to pan.
* Scroll to zoom.
* Use the word search bar to highlight words or sentences in the text.
* Choose different highlighter colours to aid with readability.
* Reset if you want a clean slate.

Features I plan to add:
* Scribble area for writing or drawing notes.
* Support for touch screens (two finger pan and pinch to zoom)
* Multiple translations/versions and languages.
* Pop up notes to describe and give context to verses and sections that need some expanding.
* Bible quiz.
* Screen reader.
* Link net to show the connection between verses. E.g prophecies are linked to where they are mentioned or fullfilled in other books or sections.
* When you search for a word, not only will it show users the number of occurances but will also display where they are and give the option to jump to the verse.
